          My name is Joseph, but I go by Joey. I'm a certified Front End
          Developer and Full Stack Software Developer thanks to Kenzie Academy.
          My time as developer has been an exciting one and while I've learned a
          lot, I am always looking into new technologies and programming
          languages so I can build projects on my own time. In fact, one of my
          biggest goals as a developer is to create my own video game! <br />{" "}
          <br /> Some of the things I do in my spare time is reading, gaming,
          playing music, cooking, and hanging out with friends and family!
